# AgentBuilder

Build production AI agents on Cloudflare's edge network with zero infrastructure.

## What Is AgentBuilder?

AgentBuilder is a framework for creating conversational AI agents that run globally on Cloudflare Workers. It provides everything you need to build, deploy, and manage AI agents at scale.

## How It Works

AgentBuilder leverages Cloudflare's primitives to deliver a seamless AI agent experience:

- **Workers**: Serverless functions for routing and UI serving
- **Durable Objects**: Stateful conversation threads with isolated SQLite databases
- **D1**: Global metadata storage for agent configurations

Each conversation thread is a Durable Object with its own SQLite instance storing message history, execution logs, tool call records, and conversation state.
