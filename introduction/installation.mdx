# Installation Guide

AgentBuilder is a vite plugin that can run as a standalone application, or mount at a subpath of an existing vite application. AgentBuilder can be run locally for development and must be deployed to Cloudflare Workers for production.

## Step 1: Create a Vite cloudflare application

First we need to create our cloudflare-based vite application.

```
pnpm add -D vite @cloudflare/vite-plugin @standardagents/builder @standardagents/cli wrangler
```

<Info>
AgentBuilder's UI is pre-compiled, so there is no need to use a front end framework. However if you plan to use the Vite application to host more than just AgentBuilder, you can also install those frameworks.
</Info>

## Step 2: Configure the Vite plugins

The second step is to configure the Cloudflare and AgentBuilder plugins. Open your `vite.config.ts` file and add the following plugins:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { agentbuilder } from '@standardagents/builder'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [cloudflare(), agentbuilder()],
})
```

## Step 3: Configure cloudflare bindings

AgentBuilder uses Cloudflare's Durable Objects and expects certain bindings to be configured in your `wrangler.jsonc` file, as well as an ASSETS binding to serve the AgentBuilder UI. To do this, create a new file called `wrangler.jsonc` in the root of your project and add the following:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "main": "worker/index.ts",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-11-07",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
	"observability": {
		"enabled": true
	},
	"assets": {
		"directory": "dist",
		"not_found_handling": "single-page-application",
		"binding": "ASSETS",
		"run_worker_first": [
			"/**"
		]
	},
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "name": "AGENT_BUILDER_THREAD",
        "class_name": "DurableThread"
      },
      {
        "name": "AGENT_BUILDER",
        "class_name": "DurableAgentBuilder"
      }
    ]
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "tag": "v1",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["DurableThread"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "v2",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["DurableAgentBuilder"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 4: Create the Durable Objects

Next we need to create a new directory `agents` in the root of our project, and add two new files: `Thread.ts` and `AgentBuilder.ts`. These are the Durable Objects that will be used to store AgentBuilder's state and each thread's state.

```typescript
// agents/Thread.ts
import { DurableThread } from 'virtual:@standardagents/builder'

export default class Thread extends DurableThread {}
```

```typescript
// agents/AgentBuilder.ts
import { DurableAgentBuilder } from 'virtual:@standardagents/builder'

export default class AgentBuilder extends DurableAgentBuilder {}
```

Additionally, create the following empty directories in the `agents` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p agents/agents agents/prompts agents/models agents/tools agents/hooks agents/api
```

## Step 5: Worker entry point

Finally, create a new directory called `worker` in the root of your project and add a new file called `index.ts` with the following content. This is the entry point for your Cloudflare Worker, and responsible for delegating requests to the AgentBuilder router:

```typescript
// worker/index.ts
import { router } from "virtual:@standardagents/builder"
import DurableThread from '../agents/Thread';
import DurableAgentBuilder from '../agents/AgentBuilder';

export default {
  fetch(request, env) {
    const res = router(request, env)
    return res ?? new Response(null, { status: 404 })
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>

export { DurableThread, DurableAgentBuilder }
```

## Step 6: Types

Types for your agents are automatically generated and placed in the .agents directory. To add this typing to your project add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
		"types": [
			"./worker-configuration.d.ts",
      ".agents/types.d.ts",
      ".agents/virtual-module.d.ts"
		]
	}
```

## Step 7: Start the development server

You can now start the development server with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

<Info>
 The development server will automatically generate the types for your agents, prompts, tools, and API routes, and spin up "miniflare" which is a local simulation of the Cloudflare worker environment.
