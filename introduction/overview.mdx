# What Is Standard Agents?

Standard Agents is a framework for creating conversational AI agents that run on Cloudflare's edge network. It provides everything you need to build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications without managing infrastructure.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Persistent Conversation Threads">
    Every conversation thread is backed by a Cloudflare Durable Object with its own isolated SQLite database. This means:
    - Message history is automatically persisted
    - Execution logs and tool calls are tracked
    - Conversation state is maintained across requests
    - No external database needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Built-in Admin UI">
    Standard Agents includes a complete admin interface for:
    - Configuring agents, models, and providers
    - Testing agents in real-time
    - Monitoring conversation threads
    - Viewing execution logs and debugging
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File-Based Auto-Discovery">
    Define agents, prompts, models, and tools as TypeScript files. No manual registration required:
    - Drop files into the `agents/` directory
    - Framework automatically discovers and loads them
    - Hot reload during development
    - Type-safe with full IntelliSense
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flexible Tool System">
    Extend your agents with custom tools using three approaches:
    - **Native Tools**: TypeScript functions with Zod schemas
    - **Prompt Tools**: Chain prompts together for complex workflows
    - **Agent Tools**: Create child threads for specialized tasks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

Standard Agents leverages Cloudflare's infrastructure primitives:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Workers">
    Serverless functions handle routing, API requests, and UI serving
  </Step>
  <Step title="Durable Objects">
    Stateful conversation threads with isolated SQLite databases store message history, logs, and state
  </Step>
  <Step title="D1 (Optional)">
    Global metadata storage for agent configurations, models, and providers
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Conversation Flow

When a user sends a message to an agent:

1. **Request arrives** at a Cloudflare Worker
2. **Durable Object loads** the conversation thread from SQLite
3. **Agent processes** the message using configured LLM and tools
4. **Tools execute** if needed (web search, database queries, etc.)
5. **Response streams** back to the client in real-time
6. **State persists** automatically in SQLite
